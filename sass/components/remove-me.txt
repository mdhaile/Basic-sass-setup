This is the components folder. Use this folder to create styles for re-occuring components in your website. 

    For example: _profile.scss. 
    
Once you've created a component, don't forget to include it in your main.scss file. 

    For example: @include "components/profile";     
    
    Note: you don't need to include the underscode or file extension when including a file. Sass takes care of that for you!
